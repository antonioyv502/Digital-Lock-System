# Digital-Lock-System (3-bit Input FSM)
This project presents the design and implementation of a finite state machine (FSM)-based digital lock system using Verilog. The system is configured to unlock only upon receiving a specific sequence of 3-bit binary inputs. The design was verified using a testbench that simulated the lockâ€™s behavior across eight different test cases. These cases included both valid and invalid input sequences to ensure the system transitions correctly between states and behaves as expected under all conditions.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Unlocks only on a **precise 3-input sequence**: `011 â†’ 111 â†’ 101`
- Resettable FSM using a `reset` signal
- `y` output (e.g., LED) goes HIGH when unlocked
- Verified with a comprehensive testbench and waveform simulation

## FSM States and Transitions

| Current State | Input `x` | Next State | Output `y` |
|---------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| S0            | 011    | S1         | 0             |
| S0            | NOT 011| S0         | 0             |
| S1            | 111    | S2         | 0             |
| S1            | NOT 111| S0         | 0             |
| S2            | 101    | S3         | 0             |
| S2            | NOT 101| S0         | 0             |
| S3            | X X X  | S0         | 1             | 


## ðŸ“¸ Simulation Waveform

The waveform shows the FSM correctly transitioning and asserting the output `y` once the correct sequence is received and shows invalid input sequences:
